This directory contains two examples of outputs of the SDNist report genreator tool (`sdnist.report`).

[mst_e10_national2019_02-12-2023T16.43.25](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/tree/main/sdnist/report/sample-reports/mst_e10_national2019_02-12-2023T16.43.25) details performance of diffrentially private data generated from the [OpenDP Libary version](https://docs.smartnoise.org/synth/synthesizers/mst.html) of the Minutemen solution to the NIST Temporal Map Challenge. The synthetizer uses a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) instantiated with noisy marginals. The structure of the PGM is a maximum spanning tree (MST) capturing the most significant pair-wise feature correlations in the ground truth data. These data are generated with default settings with an Epsilon of 10.
