Descriptions of these new five dimensions (components) are given in the components table; the components will change depending on which target data set you\u2019re using. Five dimensions are better than 22, but we actually want to get down to two dimensions so we can plot the data on simple (x,y) axes\u2013 the plots below show the data across each possible pair combination of our five components. You can compare how the shapes change between the target data and the synthetic data, and consider what that might mean in light of the component definitions.
