# SDNist Report Tool sample

This directory contains all of the materials produced in a run of the `TX` condition where the 'synthetic data' is a 50% random subsample of the original data. This directory also contains the sample synthetic data used for the specific run (tx_syn.csv). 

These reports were generated with sdnist==1.4 with the following command:

`python -m sdnist.report tx_syn.csv TX`
